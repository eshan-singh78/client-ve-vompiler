# Online Compiler Demo

This project showcases an online compiler powered by VE Compiler and Monaco Editor, allowing users to write, edit, and run code snippets in various programming languages directly from their browsers.

## Features:
- **Language Selection:** Users can choose from a range of programming languages including JavaScript, C, C++, Java, and Python.
- **Theme Selection:** The editor offers multiple themes such as Light, Dark, and High Contrast Black to customize the coding environment according to preference.
- **Real-Time Code Editing:** Utilizing the Monaco Editor, users can write and edit code comfortably with features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
- **Instant Compilation:** Upon clicking the "Run" button, the code is sent to the VE Compiler API for compilation and execution, with the output displayed in real-time.
- **Persistent Storage:** The user's code is automatically saved locally in the browser's storage, ensuring that work is preserved even if the browser is refreshed.

## Usage:
1. **Select Language:** Choose the desired programming language from the dropdown menu.
2. **Select Theme:** Customize the editor's appearance by selecting a preferred theme from the available options.
3. **Write Code:** Use the Monaco Editor to write or edit code in the selected language.
4. **Run Code:** Click the "Run" button to compile and execute the code. The output will be displayed in the adjacent panel.
5. **View Output:** The compiled output will be shown below the code editor, allowing users to review the results of their code execution.

## Important Note:
This IDE utilizes an API hosted on a free service, which may result in variable response times. Users are advised to be patient while waiting for compilation and execution to complete.
